                        Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is often regarded as one of the best footballers to have ever played the game and his performances over the better part of a decade have only helped in reinforcing that belief among football fans.

            <h2>Sporting</h2>
            <p>
                In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him to join Sporting's youth teams at the club's football academy.
            </p>
            <p>                    
                Four years later, at age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.
            </p>
            <p>
                One year later, he made his debut in the Primeira Liga, contributed 2 goals for the 3-1 win over Moreirense. His talent soon caught the eyes of football giants all over Europe, but it were the events that took place in August 2013 that would shape his future.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the 6th of August 2013, Sporting CP opened their new stadium with an inaugural match against Manchester United. Sporting CP secured a 3-1 win with Ronaldo turning heads with a mesmerizing performance, wowing even his opponents with his footwork and deft skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having impressed the Manchester United players, however, they urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.

            <h2>Manchester United</h2>
            <p>
                Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season. His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ronaldo did not disappoint. He made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Nicky Butt. His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, Ronaldo kept honing his skills on the years to come and eventually became the team captain and undoubtedly it's best player, leading the club to many glories, most notably 3 back-to-back premier league titles and a UEFA Champions League Cup. The wonder kid had become a full fledged world class player.

            <h2>Real Madrid</h2>
            <p>
                Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause. Ronaldo had became the highest paid football player in the world.
            </p>
            <p>                
                At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7, the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United, Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano. Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for Real Madrid before the 2010–11 season.
            </p>
            <p>
                A series of successful matches followed and the football player set new club records. Football analysts note that Ronaldo has a very diverse style of playing. The forward is excellent at the position of attacking midfielder and central striker.
            </p>

                No matter which foot the football player uses in order to send the ball to the goal. These qualities helped Cristiano to become the top striker in 2012/13 season. By this time the player scored 200 goals in 197 games.
            </p>
            <p>                
                On September 30, 2015 Ronaldo scored his 500th goal, again becoming the club's best striker. The Portuguese managed to score 324 times in 308 games, breaking the record of legendary Raúl, who scored 323 goals in 741 games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast-forward to the 2017/18 season where his performances in the first half of 2017 saw him claim his fifth FIFA Player of the Year award by receiving The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Borussia Dortmund. A day later, Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or for a fifth time, receiving the award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 26 May, Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title as Real Madrid completed their third consecutive Champions League triumph, becoming the first team to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season, ending the campaign with 15 goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with the Champions League winners in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave Real Madrid.

            <p>
                After a week of transfer speculation, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, plus solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs and an additional €12 million in other fees. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest ever paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Real Madrid.

            <h2>Portugal National team</h2>
            <p>
                On July 10, 2016, Ronaldo added an emotional victory to his collection. As his national team's captain, Ronaldo led Portugal to the European Championship final against France. Although he was sidelined after suffering a knee injury 25 minutes into the match, Portugal went on to win the championship title 1-0, their first international trophy.
            </p>
            <p>                
                Ronaldo's teammates said that he motivated them as team captain from the sidelines. "He gave us a lot of confidence and he said, 'Listen people, I'm sure we will win this Euro so stay together and fight for it,’” fullback Cedric Soares said after Portugal’s victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is one of the happiest moments in my career,” Ronaldo commented. ”I’ve always said I wanted to win a trophy with the national team and make history. And I did it. Thank God, things went well for us."
